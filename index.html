<h2>What's in it for me?</h2>
<p>We have a simple answer: you will learn the best and most. When we say learning, it does not mean doing rudimentary things repetitively under the wing of kind teachers. For us, learning is defined as a huge leap forward in terms of skills and personal growth. Startups we introduce to you are full of interesting and challenging projects which can take your skills to the next level. And we didn't even mention the charmingly beautiful weather and interaction with the best talents in the world.</p>

<h2>How does Startup Life work?</h2>
<p>The process divides into 3 parts; application, interview, paperwork. Firstly you fill out the <a href="http://startuplife.fi/apply">application form</a>. Do your due research on startups you want, and tell us the names and how you can make unique contributions to them. After you prove your competence with solid evidence in the application, we will connect you with startups where we think there is a good fit.</p> 

<p>Secondly you will get interviewed, most likely via Skype, by people at the startup that finds you interesting. You will get to talk with several people from founders to people who you will work most closely with at work. This is a good opportunity to show off what you have already learned about them; feedback on their products, common interests with founders, or knowledge about their market strategies and competitors.</p> 

<p>Lastly you will enter into an exciting paperwork from getting a Visa to purchasing a flight ticket, once a startup decides to hire you and you sign the contact. After this, you are all set and in for an adventure.</p>

<h2>What startups are aboard?</h2>
<p>Currently we have <a href="http://startuplife.fi/jobs" alt="jobs">70+ positions</a> in more than 30 different startups in the fields of design, technology and business. You would find household names like Evernote, and also a bit unfamiliar startups which will make you curious. Yet they are all built by a solid team full of potential. We know it, because we have met them; We toured around the region to meet a number of entrepreneurs and selected only the startups that qualify as having a good learning environment. If you are interested to know more details, you can read about <a href="http://startuplife.fi/building-startup-life/" alt=building startup life> our tour</a>.</p>

<h2>Who will be my alumni?</h2>
<p>Whenever our Startup Lifers came back to Finland, we were always surprised to see how much they have changed and learned. They literally came back a different person. Some even went on to found their own companies, like Jori and Nelli. Jori is now a founder of <a href="http://kippt.com/about">Kippt</a> (Y combinator, 2012) and Nelli of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWd3HzYw4I">Health Puzzle</a>.</p>

<p>Some even didn't come back and became an integral part of their startups. Take Mikito, our proud alumnus. He has worked at Zendesk for 2 years, and now he receives calls from the recruiting managers of tech giants like Google and Facebook. Well, the list goes on.</p>

<p>Plus, hear what our alumni say about the program.</p>
